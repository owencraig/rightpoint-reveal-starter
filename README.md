# Boilerplate presentation project
Fork me to get simple presentations using [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) with the rightpoint style and build processes baked in

## Viewing online
The slides are published to the gh-pages branch which then means you can view them at [https://owencraig.github.io/rightpoint-reveal-starter](https://owencraig.github.io/rightpoint-reveal-starter)

## Before Starting
Run: ```npm install``` and  ```bower install```

You'll most likely need gulp and bower installed locally.


## Running locally
run ```gulp``` your files will be watched for changes

## Publishing online
Assuming you've forked this repo into github, just run ``` gulp deploy ``` and it will be pushed to your [github pages branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/).

## Issues

Raise them, or even better, create a pull request
